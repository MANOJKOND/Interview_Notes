Network:-

---> A Network is a Digital Communication Network which allows nodes to share resources

Client:-

---> A Client is a Device that access a Service made available by a server

Server:-

---> A Server is a device that provides function or service for clients

Switch:-

---> Switches forward the traffic within the LAN

Router:-

---> Routers provides Connectivity between LANs
---> Routers are used to forward traffic over the network

Firewall:-

---> A firewall monitors and Control the traffic based on Configured rules
===========================================================================

---> Speed is measured in bits per Second not bytes per second


Networking Model:-

---> Networking model Provide a Structure for networking protocols and Standards

---> OSI --> Open Systems Interconnection
---> Devoloped by International Organization for Standardization(ISO)

---> The process of adding headers and trailers is called Encapsulation

---> The process of removing headers and trailers is called De-Encapsulation



Application Layer:-

--->Interacts with software applications, for example your web browser (Chrome,firefox etc)

---> HTTP and HTTPS are layer 7 Protocols

Presentation Layer:-

---> The presentation Layers job is to translate between application and network formats

Session Layer:-

---> It establishes, manages and terminates connections between the local application
(for example web browser) and the remote application(for example youtube)

Transport Layer:-

---> Breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be more easily sent over the network and are 
less likely to cause transmission problems

---> provides host-to-host Communication

Network Layer:-

---> Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (Outside of the LAN)

--->Provides Logical addressing(IP address) and path selection between source and destination

Data Link Layer:-


---> Provides node-to-node Connectivity and data transfer (for example, PC to Switch, Switch to router,
,router to router)

---> detects and corrects Physical Layer Errors

Physical Layer:-

--->Defines Physical Characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices

--->For example voltage levels, physical connectors, cable specifications

Adjacent Layer Interaction:-

---> Interaction between different layers of the OSI model

Same Layer Interaction:-

---> Refers to the interaction between the same layers on different hosts


Mac Address:-

---> 6 Byte Physical Address Assigned to the device when it is made, it is globally unique

Unicast Frame:-

---> A Frame Destined For a Single target

What is Receiver Clock Synchronization?
--->When data is sent over a network (especially over physical cables), it is sent as a stream of bits — 1s and 0s — in the form of electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves.

--->To understand these bits correctly, the receiver must know:

--->When each bit starts and ends.

Address Resolution protocol(ARP):-

--->ARP is used to discover the Layer 2 address (MAC address) of a known Layer 3 address(IP address)


Ping:-

---> Ping is a Network Utility that is used to test reachability between two devices
---> Measures Round-trip time

Loopback Address:-

---> Address range 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255
---> Used to test the 'network stack' (think OSI, TCP/IP model) on the local Device


Half Duplex:-

---> The device cannot send and receive data at the same time. if it is receiving a frame, it must wait before sending a frame

Full Duplex:-

---> The device can send and receive data at the same time.

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection(CSMA/CD)

---> It describes how devices avoid collisions in half duplex communication and how they react if Collisions occur

Speed and Duplex Auto negotiation:-

---> Which allows devices to find the appropriate speed and duplex settings without manual Configuration

Local Area Network(LAN):-

--->A LAN is a single Broadcast Domain (A broadcast domain is a group of devices that will receive a broadcast frame(Dest MAC:- FFFF.FFFF.FFFF) sent by any one of the members

Virtual Local Area Network(VLAN):-

--->VLAN's divides the single broadcast domain into multiple broadcast domains
--->VLAN's logically separate end hosts at layer2

Access port:-

--->An access port is a switchport which belongs to a single VLAN, and usually connects to end hosts like PCs

Trunk Port:-

--->Trunk Ports can carry multiple VLANs on a single interface

Router On a Stick(ROAS):-

ROAS is used to route between multiple VLANs using a single interface on the router and switch

Dynamic Trunking Protocol(DTP):-

---> DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows Cisco Switches to dynamically determine their interface status (access or trunk) without manual configuration

VLAN Trunking Protocol(VTP):-

--->VTP allows you to configure VLANs on a central VTP server switch, and other switches (VTP Clients) will synchronize their VLAN database to the server

danger of VTP:-

---> If we connect an old switch with a higher revision number to your network (and the VTP domain name matches) all switches in the domain will sync their VLAN database to that switch

Spanning Tree Protocol(STP):-

--->STP Prevents Layer2 Loops by placing redundant ports in blocking state, essentially disabling the interface.

STP states:-

1)Blocking
2)Listening
3)Learning
4)Forwarding

STP Timers:-

1)Hello Timer(2sec)
2)Forward Delay Timer(15 sec)
3)Max Age Timer(20 Sec)

STP TOOLKIT:-

1)Port fast:- Port fast allows a port to move forwarding state, bypassing Listening and Learning states

2)BPDU GUARD:- If an interface with BPDU Guard enabled receives a BPDU from another switch, the interface will be shutdown to prevent a loop from forming

EtherChannel:-

---> EtherChannel Combines a multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface. This will increases and network speed and Bandwidth.


Routing by rumour:-

--->Each router tells only its neighbouring routers what it knows about the network, and those neighbours pass the information along to their neighbours — like spreading a rumour.
